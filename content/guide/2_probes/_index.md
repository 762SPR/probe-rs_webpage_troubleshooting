The probe-rs project supports three probes out of the box.

Most of them require little to no setup. For linux, [udev](@/guide/2_probes/udev.md) rules are required for non admin access.

The [ST-Link](@/guide/2_probes/st-link.md), to [J-Link](@/guide/2_probes/j-link.md) and [CMSIS-DAP](@/guide/2_probes/cmsis-dap.md) based probes are supported.
